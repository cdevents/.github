## Hi there 👋

This is the home of the events protocol CDEvents and its related tools

CDEvents is currently governed by the [Special Interest Group Events](https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-events) within the [CD Foundation](https://cd.foundation/)

If you have a general issue for the cdevents organization it could be placed in the [spec repo](https://github.com/cdevents/spec)

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
